    "## 📊 使用 Ragas 評估簡單的 LLM 應用程式\n",
    "\n",
    "軟體開發流程，做 DevOps 的 CI/CD 迭代測試，來測試產出物的效能與品質。有完整的測試，才能為每個開發變動設立標準。\n",
    "\n",
    "我們打造一個 RAG System，我們要如何知道這個 RAG System 的效能與品質呢？是看使用者的感覺決定 RAG 的好壞嗎？顯然不是。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 本指南目標\n",
    "\n",
    "本指南的目的是展示如何使用 **Ragas** 測試與評估一個簡單的 LLM 應用工作流程。\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ragas** 是一個用於評估 Retrieval-Augmented Generation 系統表現的 Python 套件，能幫助你衡量回答的準確性、一致性與語意相關性。\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Metrics 評估指標** 是用來量化評估 AI 應用效能的工具。透過這些指標，我們可以判斷整體應用程式以及其內部各個元件在測試資料上的表現好壞。指標提供數據基礎，協助進行比較、最佳化與決策，對於 AI 應用的開發與部署過程至關重要。（例如：faithfulness, answer_relevancy, context_precision 等）\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Evaluation Data / Dataset** 是一組資料集，包含評估指標需要的各項參數，用來表示 Evaluation 的情境或是 test cases。將 RAG 的輸出加上資料集的參數輸入 Metrics 後，Metrics 回傳一個量化的結果，代表 RAG 的效能。\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Evaluation 效能評估** 對於 RAG 系統，以相同的評估資料集做測試，獲得目前 RAG 的量化效能。並依據量化的結果，調整 RAG 系統的元件，例如 embedding, prompt, 使用的 model 等等，持續改善並持續評估。\n",

    "### 🧪 評估場景：RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "在本示範中，我們將評估一個 RAG System，\n",
    "目標是確保模型產生的摘要**準確地涵蓋原始文本中的關鍵細節**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ 安裝 Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "若你想開始使用 **Ragas** 來對 RAG 系統進行評估，只需要使用 `pip` 指令來安裝："

       " 'retrieved_contexts': ['The WHO released a joined statement with the ICAO ([on the WHO website it\\'s dated 11 March 2020). It does not mention travel restrictions directly. It does, however, stress cooperation at different levels, for example between \"aviation and health authorities\". \\n\\nMy interpretation is that the WHO is leaving such restrictions up to the states, at least in their public statements. \\n',\n",
       "  'Probably because prior WHO research was rather skeptical of their ultimate effectiveness:  \\n\\n\\n  Screening and quarantining entering travelers at international borders did not substantially delay virus introduction in past pandemics, except in some island countries, and will likely be even less effective in the modern era.\\n\\n\\nThat paper was co-authored (on behalf of the WHO) by employees of the [US] CDC (lead author actually), the ECDC, the UK\\'s HPA, Australian DHA, and some of WHO\\'s own employees. So you could say it was a fairly broad consensus at the time it was written (2006).\\n\\nThe WHO has actually explained/defended their reasoning in relation to the COVID-19 outbreak in more detail in a February press release:\\n\\n\\n  WHO continues to advise against the application of travel or trade restrictions to countries experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks.\\n  \\n  In general, evidence shows that restricting the movement of people and goods during public health emergencies is ineffective in most situations and may divert resources from other interventions. Furthermore, restrictions may interrupt needed aid and technical support, may disrupt businesses, and may have negative social and economic effects on the affected countries. However, in certain circumstances, measures that restrict the movement of people may prove temporarily useful, such as in settings with few international connections and limited response capacities.\\n  \\n  Travel measures that significantly interfere with international traffic may only be justified at the beginning of an outbreak, as they may allow countries to gain time, even if only a few days, to rapidly implement effective preparedness measures. Such restrictions must be based on a careful risk assessment, be proportionate to the public health risk, be short in duration, and be reconsidered regularly as the situation evolves.\\n  \\n  Travel bans to affected areas or denial of entry to passengers coming from affected areas are usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact. Since WHO declaration of a public health emergency of international concern in relation to COVID-19, and as of 27 February, 38 countries have reported to WHO additional health measures that significantly interfere with international traffic in relation to travel to and from China or other countries, ranging from denial of entry of passengers, visa restrictions or quarantine for returning travellers. Several countries that denied entry of travellers or who have suspended the flights to and from China or other affected countries, are now reporting cases of COVID-19.\\n  \\n  Temperature screening alone, at exit or entry, is not an effective way to stop international spread, since infected individuals may be in incubation period, may not express apparent symptoms early on in the course of the disease, or may dissimulate fever through the use of antipyretics; in addition, such measures require substantial investments for what may bear little benefits. [...]\\n\\n\\nI haven\\'t found more recent press releases on this matter, especially after the US and the EU have imposed much more wider travel bans. I do wonder the extent to which the WHO might have reconsidered that initial approach...\\n\\nAside, comment on the question... I wonder why you found it necessary to use \"that guy from India\" as the motivator for this question when (in the US) a poll published on March 26 says...\\n\\n\\n  In thinking about specific steps that have been announced to address the coronavirus outbreak, majorities of Republicans and Democrats view a range of measures as necessary to stem the spread of the virus.

       "  'This answer currently lists nationwide entry restrictions imposed by the United States federal (national) government. A majority of states as well as counties, municipalities, towns, and cities have imposed entry bans or automatic quarantine-upon-entry orders as well as stay-at-home orders that may prevent your intended travel. This answer cannot index all of these orders, which have slight differences, technicalities, and effective dates that must be consulted to determine if your planned travel activity is allowed under state and local law. NBC News provides a basic overview as of April 5, 2020. Additionally, travelers should be aware that their home countries consulates in the US may not be operating normally.\\n\\nUnder the new rules, all flights carrying at least one non-crew passenger that has been physically present anywhere in mainland China, Iran, the Schengen Area, or the Common Travel Area (UK/Ireland) within the past 14 days must land at one of the following airports:\\n\\n\\nJFK - New York, NY\\nORD - Chicago, IL\\nSFO - San Francisco, CA\\nSEA - Seattle/Tacoma, WA\\nHNL - Honolulu, HI\\nLAX - Los Angeles, CA\\nATL - Atlanta, GA\\nIAD - Washington, DC\\n\\n\\nThe following airports were added February 3, 2020:\\n\\n\\nEWR - Newark, NJ\\nDFW - Dallas/Fort Worth, TX\\nDTW - Detroit, MI\\n\\n\\nThe following airports were added March 14, 2020:\\n\\n\\nBOS - Boston, MA\\nMIA - Miami, FL\\n\\n\\nAdditionally, such individuals cannot travel to the US at all unless they meet one of these exceptions:\\n\\n\\nUS citizens and nationals\\nlawful permanent residents (green card holders)\\nspouses of citizens or LPRs\\nparents of unmarried citizens/LPRs under 21\\nsiblings of citizens/LPRs, both unmarried and under 21\\nchildren, foster children, and adoptees of citizens/LPRs\\nair and sea crew members\\ndiplomats and foreign officials\\nthose granted exceptions by high-level officials\\n\\n\\nUpon arrival, such excepted passengers will be subject to public health screenings by US Public Health Service personnel. At a press briefing on Jan. 31, 2020 (transcript), Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar announced that individuals who have been to Hubei Province in the 14 days preceding entry will be sent to a 14-day quarantine, and individuals who have been to other parts of mainland China in the 14 days preceding entry will self-monitor for symptoms for 14 days at home. This is the first major federal quarantine action since the 1960s.\\n\\nThis action does not affect aliens (immigrants or nonimmigrants) already in the US. It does not cancel or revoke valid visas, though it temporarily prevents their use and may prevent the issuance of new visas in some cases.\\n\\nAdditionally, entering the US through land borders from Canada or Mexico is limited to \"essential travel\":\\n\\n\\nUS citizens and permanent residents returning to the US\\nTravel for medical purposes\\nTravel to attend educational institutions\\nTravel to work in the US\\nTravel for emergency response and public health purposes\\nLawful cross-border trade\\nOfficial government or diplomatic travel\\nUS armed forces and their family returning to the US\\nMilitary-related travel\\n\\n\\nQuestions and Answers\\n\\nDoes this include only mainland China, or other territories as well? The 14-day rule does not apply the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau. It does apply to the disputed province of Tibet. It does not apply to Taiwan, the Republic of China, which is claimed by the People\\'s Republic of China but is not functionally a part of that country.\\n\\nDoes this include British territories as well? The proclamation covering the UK excludes \"overseas territories outside of Europe\". This seems to mean that Gibraltar and the Crown Dependencies are included, but other British territories are excluded.\\n\\nDo the US-Canada and US-Mexico border restrictions apply to air travel? Not at this time.\\n\\nWhen do these restrictions take effect?\\n\\n\\nFor China: February 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST\\nFor Iran: March 2, 2020 at 5:00pm EST\\nFor the Schengen Area: March 13, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.\\nFor the Common Travel Area: March 16, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.\\nLand border restrictions: March 20, 2020 at 11:59pm EDT.\\n\\n\\nWhere are these regulations found? The Department of Homeland Security has a page on air travel restrictions, a fact sheet, and a list of news and updates. The CDC has a page on procedures for travelers from the affected countries.\\n\\nThe recent extension of restrictions to the Common Travel Area, consisting of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, was announced by US Vice President Pence at a press conference Saturday the 14th. Official regulations have yet to be promulgated.\\n\\nRegulations on flights arriving in the US needing to be redirected to certain airports, published in the Federal Register:\\n\\n\\nFor China: this document, with additional airports provided in this document\\nFor Iran: this document\\nFor the Schengen Area: this document with additional airports\\nFor the UK and Ireland: this document\\n\\n\\nThe Presidential Proclamations banning entry of certain sub-classes of these individuals:\\n\\n\\nFor China: here\\nFor Iran: here\\nFor the Schengen Area: here\\nFor the UK and Ireland: here\\n\\n\\nDHS has announcements for the US-Canada and US-Mexico land border restrictions, and the rules can be found in the Federal Register:\\n\\n\\nFor US-Canada land border: this document\\nFor US-Mexico land border: this document\\n\\n\\nHow long will these restrictions last? The restrictions will remain in effect until further notice from the government. With respect to the entry ban specifically, the Secretary of Health and Human Services is to advise the President at least every 15 days whether or not the ban should be changed or cancelled. The land border restrictions last until April 20, 11:59pm EDT.\\n\\nWho made this decision, why, and what is there authority to do so? The Secretary of Homeland Security made the decision to impose new travel restrictions. The Secretary has the legal authority to designate the places at which flights inbound to the US may land for inspection. The Secretary decided that this measure was necessary to prevent serious harm to the national security.\\n\\nThe President has the authority to suspend the entry of aliens into the US as needed for national security. President Trump found that the federal government is incapable of monitoring all of the 14,000 daily travels between China and the US. Therefore, this rule is needed to protect the public health and safety of America.\\n\\nThe CDC has authority to enact quarantines under the Public Health Service Act.\\n\\nWhat if I do not comply with these rules? If you lie to officials about your presence in China to avoid the regulations, you could face serious immigration consequences including expedited removal from the country and a permanent inadmissibility in the future. If you attempt to escape quarantine, the government may use lawful force to prevent you from doing so.\\n'],\n",
