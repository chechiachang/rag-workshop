    "軟體開發流程，做 DevOps 的 CI/CD 迭代測試，來測試產出物的效能與品質。有完整的測試，才能為每個開發變動設立標準。\n",
    "\n",
    "我們打造一個 RAG System，我們要如何知道這個 RAG System 的效能與品質呢？是看使用者的感覺決定 RAG 的好壞嗎？顯然不是。\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 本指南目標\n",
    "\n",
    "本指南的目的是展示如何使用 **Ragas** 測試與評估一個簡單的 LLM 應用工作流程。\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Ragas** 是一個用於評估 Retrieval-Augmented Generation 系統表現的 Python 套件，能幫助你衡量回答的準確性、一致性與語意相關性。\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Metrics 評估指標** 是用來量化評估 AI 應用效能的工具。透過這些指標，我們可以判斷整體應用程式以及其內部各個元件在測試資料上的表現好壞。指標提供數據基礎，協助進行比較、最佳化與決策，對於 AI 應用的開發與部署過程至關重要。（例如：faithfulness, answer_relevancy, context_precision 等）\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Evaluation Data / Dataset** 是一組資料集，包含評估指標需要的各項參數，用來表示 Evaluation 的情境或是 test cases。將 RAG 的輸出加上資料集的參數輸入 Metrics 後，Metrics 回傳一個量化的結果，代表 RAG 的效能。\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Evaluation 效能評估** 對於 RAG 系統，以相同的評估資料集做測試，獲得目前 RAG 的量化效能。並依據量化的結果，調整 RAG 系統的元件，例如 embedding, prompt, 使用的 model 等等，持續改善並持續評估。\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧪 評估場景：RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "在本示範中，我們將評估一個 RAG System，\n",
    "目標是確保模型產生的摘要**準確地涵蓋原始文本中的關鍵細節**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ 安裝 Ragas\n",

    "若你想開始使用 **Ragas** 來對 RAG 系統進行評估，只需要使用 `pip` 指令來安裝："

       "  'Rather poorly one could say, with respect to testing. There\\'s now outrage that the CDC has pursued its own flawed test kit under some version of NIH (which in this case stands for \"not invented here\"), rather than adopt the one used by the WHO (and which was developed in Germany)...\\n\\n\\n  On Monday, following mounting criticism of the federal response, Trump administration officials promised a rapid expansion of the country’s testing capacities. With the help of private companies and academic centers, as many as a million diagnostic tests could be administered by the end of this week, said Dr. Stephen Hahn, commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\\n  \\n  But many scientists wonder if the moves come too late. [...] Most disturbing of all: Did a failure to provide adequate testing give the coronavirus time to gain a toehold in the United States?\\n  \\n  “Clearly, there have been problems with rolling out the test,” said Dr. Thomas Frieden, former director of the C.D.C. “There are a lot of frustrated doctors and patients and health departments.”\\n  \\n  Still, Dr. Frieden said he thought the situation was improving. Other experts, although supportive of the agency, were mystified that federal officials could have committed so many missteps.\\n  \\n  “The incompetence has really exceeded what anyone would expect with the C.D.C.,” said Dr. Michael Mina, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. “This is not a difficult problem to solve in the world of viruses.”\\n  \\n  Officials at the C.D.C. did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The agency abruptly canceled a news conference on Monday just as it was to begin. Officials appeared to have removed figures on the agency website counting how many Americans had been tested.\\n  \\n  In February, the C.D.C. rolled out a three-step diagnostic test and distributed testing kits — each of which could run about 800 tests — to state and local health laboratories. But some of the components of the diagnostic kits were flawed, and produced inconclusive results.\\n  \\n  A three-step replacement was promised but never arrived; the agency has not fully explained why, except to say that there was a manufacturing defect. As a result, diagnostic testing was only conducted at the agency’s labs in Atlanta.\\n  \\n  The C.D.C. eventually rolled out a two-step replacement and permitted a few laboratories, where the kits had been working, to continue using their tests. But those with only one working component of the test still could not diagnose patients on their own.\\n  \\n  Getting results from the C.D.C. took days, however, and in any event the criteria for testing were strict — among them, the patient must have had recent travel to China or contact with someone known to be infected.\\n  \\n  Doctors nationwide complained of a bottleneck, both because of the restrictive test criteria and because of the agency’s limited testing capacity. The agency said it had the capacity to test about 400 specimens a day.\\n  \\n  The test criteria were “too stringent, and people aren’t getting tested,” said Lauren M. Sauer, an assistant professor of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\\n  \\n  [...]\\n  \\n  “We have been really frustrated, because one of the things that is a hallmark of public health labs is that we are usually ‘ready, set, go,’ and here we were — ‘ready, set, wait’,” said Scott Becker, chief executive of the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\\n  \\n  Late last week, the Food and Drug Administration broke the logjam, authorizing state and local laboratories to do initial testing on their own. If labs had developed and validated a test, they could use it for diagnosis instead of relying on the C.D.C.’s version or waiting for a replacement.\\n  \\n  Other nations have tested patients by tens of thousands. China has probably tested millions.\\n  \\n  “How come the South Koreans can do 10,000 tests a day and we can’t?” said Ralph Baric, who studies coronaviruses and emerging diseases at University of North Carolina.\\n  \\n  Soon after the virus surfaced in China, the C.D.C. got to work on its own test. “Generally, C.D.C. provides these tests for the world,” said Dr. Frieden.\\n  \\n  But German researchers were devising their own test, which was quickly adopted by the World Health Organization for distribution around the world.\\n  \\n  After the C.D.C.’s version turned out to be flawed, the agency continued to pursue it, despite the fact that another diagnostic test was already in wide use.\\n  \\n  With F.D.A. approval, the agency could simply have distributed the test used by the W.H.O. instead of creating a new one from scratch, Dr. Mina said. The government could do so even now.\\n  \\n  “It’s just a very American approach to say, ‘We’re the U.S., the major U.S. public health lab, and we’re going to not follow the leader,’” Dr. Mina said.\\n\\n'],\n",

    "1. **使用收集到的資料集**  \n",
    "   基於先前收集的查詢、系統回應及擷取的上下文，進行模型效能評估。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **選擇評估指標**  \n",
    "   使用常見的 RAG 評估指標，例如：\n",
    "   - 回答正確性（Answer Correctness）\n",
    "   - 上下文相關性（Context Relevance）\n",
    "   - 回應完整性（Answer Completeness）\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **選擇評估模型**  \n",
    "   你可以選擇任意一個 LLM 作為評估器（Evaluator LLM）來執行這些評估任務。\n",

    "## 1. LLM Context Recall（LLM 上下文召回率）\n",
    "- **說明**：衡量 LLM 回應中是否使用了檢索到的上下文資訊。\n",
    "- **目標**：確保模型的回答有依據地參考了相關的背景資料。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Faithfulness（忠實度）\n",
    "- **說明**：評估回應是否忠實反映檢索到的內容。\n",
    "- **目標**：避免 LLM 編造（hallucinate）資訊，確保回答與來源資料一致。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Factual Correctness（事實正確性）\n",
    "- **說明**：判斷 LLM 回應的事實是否正確，不僅限於上下文來源，也包括一般常識與外部知識。\n",
    "- **目標**：減少錯誤或誤導性的回答。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Noise Sensitivity（雜訊敏感度）\n",
    "- **說明**：評估模型在面對含有雜訊或不相關資訊的上下文時，是否仍能做出正確判斷。\n",
    "- **目標**：強化模型的抗雜訊能力，提升實用性。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Response Relevancy（回應相關性）\n",
    "- **說明**：評估 LLM 回應是否與使用者查詢高度相關。\n",
    "- **目標**：確保回答內容精準聚焦於問題本身。\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Context Entity Recall（上下文實體召回率）\n",
    "- **說明**：檢查模型是否成功提取上下文中與查詢相關的重要實體（例如人名、地名、產品名等）。\n",
    "- **目標**：提升資訊擷取的完整性與語意理解。\n",
