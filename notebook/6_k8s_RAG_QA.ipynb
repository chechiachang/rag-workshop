This allows for\\ncentralized management of the IP address ranges used for Services and helps\\nprevent unintended or conflicting configurations. Kubernetes provides mechanisms\\nlike Validating Admission Policies to enforce these rules.\\n\\n### Preventing Unauthorized ServiceCIDR Creation/Update using Validating Admission Policy\\n\\nThere can be situations that the cluster administrators want to restrict the\\nranges that can be allowed or to completely deny any changes to the cluster\\nService IP ranges.\\n\\n{{< note >}}\\nThe default \"kubernetes\" ServiceCIDR is created by the kube-apiserver\\nto provide consistency in the cluster and is required for the cluster to work,\\nso it always must be allowed. You can ensure your `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy`\\ndoesn\\'t restrict the default ServiceCIDR by adding the clause:\\n\\n```yaml\\n  matchConditions:\\n  - name: \\'exclude-default-servicecidr\\'\\n    expression: \"object.metadata.name != \\'kubernetes\\'\"\\n```\\n\\nas in the examples below.\\n{{</ note >}}\\n\\n#### Restrict Service CIDR ranges to some specific ranges\\n\\nThe following is an example of a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` that only allows\\nServiceCIDRs to be created if they are subranges of the given `allowed` ranges.\\n(So the example policy would allow a ServiceCIDR with `cidrs: [\\'10.96.1.0/24\\']`\\nor `cidrs: [\\'2001:db8:0:0:ffff::/80\\', \\'10.96.0.0/20\\']` but would not allow a\\nServiceCIDR with `cidrs: [\\'172.20.0.0/16\\']`.) You can copy this policy and change\\nthe value of `allowed` to something appropriate for you cluster.\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1\\nkind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicy\\nmetadata:\\n  name: \"servicecidrs.default\"\\nspec:\\n  failurePolicy: Fail\\n  matchConstraints:\\n    resourceRules:\\n    - apiGroups:   [\"networking.k8s.io\"]\\n      apiVersions: [\"v1\",\"v1beta1\"]\\n      operations:  [\"CREATE\", \"UPDATE\"]\\n      resources:   [\"servicecidrs\"]\\n  matchConditions:\\n  - name: \\'exclude-default-servicecidr\\'\\n    expression: \"object.metadata.name != \\'kubernetes\\'\"\\n  variables:\\n  - name: allowed\\n    expression: \"[\\'10.96.0.0/16\\',\\'2001:db8::/64\\']\"\\n  validations:\\n  - expression: \"object.spec.cidrs.all(newCIDR, variables.allowed.exists(allowedCIDR, cidr(allowedCIDR).containsCIDR(newCIDR)))\"\\n  # For all CIDRs (newCIDR) listed in the spec.cidrs of the submitted ServiceCIDR\\n  # object, check if there exists at least one CIDR (allowedCIDR) in the `allowed`\\n  # list of the VAP such that the allowedCIDR fully contains the newCIDR.\\n---\\napiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1\\nkind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding\\nmetadata:\\n  name: \"servicecidrs-binding\"\\nspec:\\n  policyName: \"servicecidrs.default\"\\n  validationActions: [Deny,Audit]\\n```\\n\\nConsult the [CEL documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/cel/)\\nto learn more about CEL if you want to write your own validation `expression`.\\n\\n#### Restrict any usage of the ServiceCIDR API\\n\\nThe following example demonstrates how to use a `ValidatingAdmissionPolicy` and\\nits binding to restrict the creation of any new Service CIDR ranges, excluding the default \"kubernetes\" ServiceCIDR:\\n\\n```yaml\\napiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1\\nkind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicy\\nmetadata:\\n  name: \"servicecidrs.deny\"\\nspec:\\n  failurePolicy: Fail\\n  matchConstraints:\\n    resourceRules:\\n    - apiGroups:   [\"networking.k8s.io\"]\\n      apiVersions: [\"v1\",\"v1beta1\"]\\n      operations:  [\"CREATE\", \"UPDATE\"]\\n      resources:   [\"servicecidrs\"]\\n  validations:\\n  - expression: \"object.metadata.name == \\'kubernetes\\'\"\\n---\\napiVersion: admissionregistration.k8s.io/v1\\nkind: ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding\\nmetadata:\\n  name: \"servicecidrs-deny-binding\"\\nspec:\\n  policyName: \"servicecidrs.deny\"\\n  validationActions: [Deny,Audit]\\n```\\n')"
